  5x8 : defines the size of the grid. 5 columns and 8 rows.
  Each "|" means one row, each row has 5 cells separated by ",". Put identifiers in cells to create input widgets.

joystick examples :
  j0-x-y : j0 is the gyroscope, -x-y means the input goes into x and y axis of the virtual joystick.
  j1-z-n-3x3 : j1 is an ordinary joystick, -z-n means the horizontal input goes into the z axis of the virtual joystick and the virtical input is ignored(n is ignore). 3x3 is the size of the joystick.
    there are 8 axes available on the virtual joystick : x, y, z, rx, ry, rz, sl0, sl1

joystick button examples :
  b1 : button 1 of the virtual joystick
  b7-R : button 7 of the virtual joystick, but renamed as "R"
  b8-CustomName-h : button 8, renamed as "CustomName", and is a toggle button
    b1~b16 are available. If you are using b9 or above, you need to change vJoy configuration because vJoy only supports 8 buttons by default. 

keyboard examples :
  k-z : emulates "Z" key in keyboard
  k-x-somename : emulates "X" key in keyboard, renamed as "somename"
  k-space : emulates space key in keyboard
